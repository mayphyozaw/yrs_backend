Using Advance Laravel Design Pattern 
===================================

Controllers ----------> Repository ------------> Database


Backend
---------------
Authentication 
    1. admin Authentication
    2. user Authentication for frontend users 
    3. Ticket Inspector 
    
Admin panel =====> Use adminite(bootstrap4)
                    tailwindcss

bootstrap4=>tailwind => https://github.vue.tailwind-prefix.cbass.dev/

flashmessage=> When use the jsvalidation, use the flashmessage.

toastify => from serverside


=> color pattern => gradient color pattern 
                linear-gradient(90deg,#3CACB6 0%, #8CCEAD 90%)
               #1CBC9B               

For Icon => flaticon.com/authors/super-basic-straight/gradient?author_id=1

way 1 => using leafletjs.com for route-station
openstreetmap

way 2 => mapbox => just like the google map but fee with credit card

way 3 => maptiler => 


each map has the most important thing that is the layer 

for latitude and logitude point => leaftlet location picker 

from => https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-locationpicker/tree/master/src

layer -> OSM -> OSM means open street map



using jquery repeater for route (clockwise and anticlockwise)

from laravel documentation, 

in pivotTable=> mapWithKeys() and sync() using


to add the marker icon => route=>show.blade.php => from leaflet documentation

recheck the Backend

1. checking the query in  Repository whether relationships with other tables or not.
    if there is the relationship with the other tables, change the query to eager loading 

    in TicketRepository => change the query to with 
        $model = $this->model::query();

firstOfCreate() => [], []
[] for condition
[] for amount


admin panel -> email verified => using laravel breeze from documentation

format('%i minutes and %s seconds') => PHP Carbon default
